US-S08 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-S09 through US-S22), so the work continues.

**Summary of US-S08:**
- Created `src/lib/sync/journal.ts` with:
  - `pushJournalEntries()`: uploads local IndexedDB journal entries to Supabase
  - `pullJournalEntries()`: downloads from Supabase and merges to local
  - `syncJournalEntries()`: convenience function for two-way sync
- Implements last-write-wins conflict resolution based on `updated_at` timestamp
- Uses `quote_id` as the unique key per user (each user has one reflection per quote)
- All quality checks passed (typecheck + build)
- Committed: `3f7a4ed feat: US-S08 - Create sync service for journal entries`
