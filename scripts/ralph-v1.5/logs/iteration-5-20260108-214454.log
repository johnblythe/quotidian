## Summary

**US-S05: Show signed-in state throughout app** - COMPLETE

Implemented:
- **useAuth hook** (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`) - Reusable hook that tracks auth state across the app. Returns `user`, `isLoading`, `isSupabaseConfigured`, and `isSignedIn`.
- **Sync indicator** - Green dot appears on Settings nav icon when user is signed in (visible in Navigation component)
- **Account page refactored** - Now uses useAuth hook instead of duplicating auth logic

Files changed:
- Created: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Modified: `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Modified: `src/app/account/page.tsx`

All quality checks pass (typecheck + build). Committed as `feat: US-S05 - Show signed-in state throughout app`.
