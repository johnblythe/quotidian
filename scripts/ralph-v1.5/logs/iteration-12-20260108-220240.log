There are still 10 stories with `passes: false`. US-S12 is complete. The next iteration will pick up US-S13 (Create share card generator).

**Summary of US-S12 completion:**
- Created `src/lib/sync/conflicts.ts` - centralized conflict resolution module with:
  - `resolveConflict()` - compares timestamps and logs conflicts
  - `getConflictLog()` - returns recent conflicts for debugging
  - `getConflictSummary()` - aggregate stats
- Updated `src/lib/sync/preferences.ts` and `src/lib/sync/journal.ts` to use the new module
- All conflicts are resolved automatically (last-write-wins) with debug logging
- No user-facing merge dialogs needed
