There are still 5 stories with `passes: false` (US-S18 through US-S22). Story US-S17 is now complete.

**Summary of US-S17 implementation:**
- Added native share (Web Share API) functionality to ShareModal
- Feature detection: checks `navigator.share` and `navigator.canShare`
- Shares image + quote text when supported, falls back to text-only, then shows error directing to Copy/Download
- User cancellation handled gracefully (no error shown)
- Full status indicators: idle, sharing, success, error
