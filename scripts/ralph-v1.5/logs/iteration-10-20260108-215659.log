There are still 12 stories with `passes: false`. The story US-S10 is complete. Another iteration will pick up US-S11.

**Completed: US-S10 - Create sync service for quote history**

Created `src/lib/sync/history.ts` with:
- `pushHistory()` - uploads local history to Supabase
- `pullHistory()` - downloads from Supabase to local  
- `syncHistory()` - bidirectional sync (pull then push)

Key design: Uses `quoteId:shownAt` as composite key for deduplication since the same quote can be shown multiple times. History is append-only, making it simpler than other sync services (no delete/conflict logic needed).
