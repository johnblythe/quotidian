I've completed **US-S06: Create Supabase schema (tables, RLS)**.

**Summary:**
- Created `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` with 5 tables:
  - `preferences` - user settings with digest_enabled field
  - `journal_entries` - reflections with timestamps
  - `favorites` - saved quotes with unique constraint
  - `quote_history` - shown quotes with fresh_pull flag
  - `signals` - behavior signals with themes array
- All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with user-scoped policies
- Created TypeScript types in `src/types/supabase.ts`
- Both `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass
- Committed as: `feat: US-S06 - Create Supabase schema (tables, RLS)`

There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-S07 through US-S22), so another iteration will continue with US-S07.
