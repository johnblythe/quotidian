**US-S03 Complete.** 

Implemented:
- `/account/signin` page with email input and "Send magic link" button
- Uses `signInWithOtp({ email })` to send passwordless magic link
- Shows "Check your email" confirmation after sending
- `/account/callback` page handles the redirect from magic link click
- Callback auto-parses tokens from URL hash, detects session, redirects to /account

Files created:
- `src/app/account/signin/page.tsx`
- `src/app/account/callback/page.tsx`

There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-S04 through US-S22).
