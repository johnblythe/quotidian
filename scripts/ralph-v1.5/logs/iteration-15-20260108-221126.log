**US-S15: Implement copy to clipboard** is complete.

**Summary:**
- Added copy functionality to ShareModal using ClipboardItem API with PNG blob
- Button shows different states: idle → copying (spinner) → success (checkmark)
- Toast notification displays success or fallback messages
- Fallback to text copy when image clipboard not supported or fails
- All acceptance criteria met: typecheck and build pass

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-S16 through US-S22), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
