**Completed: US-002 - Configure PWA with manifest and service worker**

Summary of changes:
- Installed `next-pwa` package
- Created `public/manifest.json` with Quotidian branding and warm colors (#fafaf8)
- Generated placeholder PNG icons (192x192, 512x512) 
- Configured `next.config.ts` with withPWA wrapper
- Added TypeScript declarations for next-pwa (custom .d.ts since @types/next-pwa doesn't support Next 16)
- Updated build script to use `--webpack` flag for next-pwa compatibility
- Added SW files to `.gitignore`

Key learnings documented:
- next-pwa requires webpack mode in Next.js 16+
- Service worker files are generated in `public/`, not `.next/`
- Custom type declarations needed for untyped packages in src/types/
