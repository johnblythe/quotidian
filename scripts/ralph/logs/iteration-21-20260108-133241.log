US-024 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-025 through US-030), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-024 implementation:**
- Added `remainingPulls` prop to `ActionButtons` component
- Button displays "Another (X left)" showing remaining daily pulls
- Button is disabled (grayed out, non-clickable) when 0 pulls remaining
- Homepage tracks remaining pulls state, checks `getFreshPullsToday()` on mount
- Each "Another" click increments fresh pulls in history and decrements the count
- Also records today's initial quote being shown (not counted as a fresh pull)
