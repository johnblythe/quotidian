**US-015: Add Greeting to homepage** - Complete ✓

**Summary:**
- Added Greeting component import to homepage
- Changed from `isOnboarded()` to `getPreferences()` to fetch user name
- Added `userName` state to store the name
- Greeting displays above the quote when user is logged in
- After onboarding completes, fetches preferences again for immediate greeting

**UI Verification needed:**
- Homepage should show "Good morning/afternoon/evening, {name}" above the daily quote
- Greeting uses subtle styling (text-foreground/60) for muted appearance
- After completing onboarding, greeting should appear immediately with the user's name
