There are still 2 stories remaining (US-029 Settings page and US-030 expand quotes). The work continues in the next iteration.

**Completed: US-028 - Create Favorites page**

- Lists all favorited quotes using `getFavorites()` (newest first)
- Uses the reusable `Quote` component for display
- Shows "Saved [date]" below each quote
- Empty state: "No favorites yet" with helper text
- All quality checks passed (typecheck + build)
- Committed with: `feat: US-028 - Create Favorites page`
