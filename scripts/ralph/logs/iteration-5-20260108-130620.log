US-008 is complete. There are still many stories with `passes: false` (US-009 through US-030), so I'll end my response normally for the next iteration to continue.

**Summary of US-008 completion:**
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to import and use `getTodaysQuote()` from `@/lib/quotes`
- Removed the hardcoded sample quote
- Homepage now displays a deterministic daily quote based on current date
- TypeScript and build checks pass
- Committed as `feat: US-008 - Build basic Today's Quote page`
