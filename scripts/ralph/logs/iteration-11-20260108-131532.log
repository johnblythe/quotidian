**US-014 Complete.** 

Created `src/components/Greeting.tsx` with:
- Time-based greeting logic (morning 5am-12pm, afternoon 12pm-5pm, evening 5pm-5am)
- Props: `name` string
- Subtle styling positioned above the quote

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-015 through US-030), so the next iteration will continue with US-015: Add Greeting to homepage.
