There's still one story remaining (US-030). Let me complete my iteration here - another agent will pick up the final story.

**Summary: Completed US-029 - Create Settings page**

- Created `/src/app/settings/page.tsx` with:
  - Name input pre-filled from preferences
  - Notification time picker pre-filled from preferences  
  - Save button that updates IndexedDB via `savePreferences()`
  - "Saved!" confirmation that displays for 2 seconds
  - Consistent styling with the app aesthetic
- All quality checks pass (typecheck + build)
- Committed changes to `ralph/quotidian-mvp` branch
- Updated PRD to mark story as `passes: true`
- Appended progress to log

One story remains: **US-030 - Expand quote seed data**.
