US-017 is complete. Let me verify not all stories are done yet by checking the PRD - there are still stories US-018 through US-030 with `passes: false`.

**Summary of US-017 completion:**
- Added three adaptive states to ReflectionEditor based on content length
- **Minimal** (< 100 chars): compact padding, smaller text, 80px min-height
- **Standard** (100-500 chars): medium padding, standard text, 120px min-height  
- **Focused** (> 500 chars): generous padding, larger text with loose leading, 160px min-height, word count visible
- Smooth CSS transitions (300ms ease-in-out) between all states
- TypeScript types and build both pass
