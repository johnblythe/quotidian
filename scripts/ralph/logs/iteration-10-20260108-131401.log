US-013 is complete. There are still 17 stories with `passes: false` (US-014 through US-030), so the next iteration will pick up US-014.

**Summary of US-013:**
- Converted homepage to client component with three states: loading, onboarding, quote
- Homepage checks `isOnboarded()` on mount
- Shows Onboarding component if not onboarded
- Transitions to quote view after onboarding completes
- Shows quote immediately if already onboarded
- All quality checks pass, committed successfully
