US-C13 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` in the PRD (US-C14 through US-C20), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-C13 completion:**
- Added `getPopularCollections()` function to `src/lib/collections.ts` that queries public collections with follower counts and sorts by popularity
- Updated `src/app/discover/page.tsx` to display the "Popular" section with real data
- Shows top 10 public collections ordered by follower count
- Displays title, follower count, and public icon for each collection
- Includes loading skeleton and empty state
- Both `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass
- Committed as `feat: US-C13 - Implement popular collections query`
