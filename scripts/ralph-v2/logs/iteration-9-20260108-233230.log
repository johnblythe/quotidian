US-C09 is complete. Let me check the remaining user stories:

From the PRD, there are still user stories with `passes: false`:
- US-C10: Implement delete collection
- US-C11: Implement edit collection
- US-C12: Create Discover page
- US-C13: Implement popular collections query
- US-C14: Implement new collections query
- US-C15: Implement follow collection
- US-C16: Implement unfollow collection
- US-C17: Show followed collections in My Collections
- US-C18: Extend Journey type for collections
- US-C19: Add 'Start Journey' button on collection
- US-C20: Implement collection-based journey flow

There are still 11 stories with `passes: false`, so the work continues.

**Summary of US-C09 completion:**
- Added X remove button to each quote in collection detail view (owner-only)
- Created confirmation dialog with quote text preview
- Integrated `removeQuoteFromCollection` from collections lib
- Added success toast with auto-hide after 3 seconds
