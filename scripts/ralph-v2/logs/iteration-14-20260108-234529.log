There are still 6 stories with `passes: false` (US-C15 through US-C20), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-C14 implementation:**
- Added `NewCollection` interface with `quote_count` field to `src/lib/collections.ts`
- Added `getNewCollections(limit)` function that queries public collections from the last 30 days, ordered by `created_at` desc
- Updated `src/app/discover/page.tsx` to:
  - Fetch both popular and new collections in parallel
  - Display "New" section with collection cards showing title, quote count, and public icon
  - Loading skeleton and empty state for when no new collections exist
- All quality checks pass (typecheck + build)
- Commit: `feat: US-C14 - Implement new collections query`
