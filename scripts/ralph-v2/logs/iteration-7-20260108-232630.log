**US-C07 Complete!**

Implemented the Collection detail page at `src/app/collections/[id]/page.tsx` with:
- Dynamic route using `useParams()` to get collection ID
- Collection header with title, visibility icon (lock/globe), description, and quote count
- Full quote list using the existing `Quote` component
- Error state for not found / inaccessible collections  
- Empty state for collections with no quotes
- Loading skeleton while fetching
- Back navigation link

There are still 13 stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-C08 through US-C20), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
