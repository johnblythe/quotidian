**US-C02 Complete.** 

Created `collection_follows` table migration with:
- Composite primary key (user_id, collection_id)
- Foreign keys to auth.users and collections with CASCADE delete
- RLS policies for users to manage their own follows
- Additional policy for viewing follows on public collections (needed for follower counts)
- Indexes on both columns for query performance

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-C03 through US-C20 remain).
