**Summary:**
- Added `JourneyType = 'preset' | 'collection'` type to `src/types/index.ts`
- Added `type: JourneyType` and optional `collectionId?: string` to `UserJourney` interface
- Updated Dexie DB to version 6 with migration to set existing journeys to `type='preset'`
- Added `startCollectionJourney()`, `isCollectionJourney()`, and `getActiveJourneyType()` functions to `src/lib/journeys.ts`
- Both `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass
