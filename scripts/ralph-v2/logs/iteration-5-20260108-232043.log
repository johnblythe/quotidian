US-C05 is complete. Let me check if there are more stories with `passes: false` - there are (US-C06 through US-C20), so the work continues in the next iteration.

**Summary of US-C05:**
- Added "+ New Collection" button to the AddToCollectionModal
- Created inline form with title (required), description (optional), and visibility toggle (Private/Public)
- Form saves new collection to Supabase and auto-selects it
- Both typecheck and build pass
- Committed changes with message: `feat: US-C05 - Create 'New collection' form`
