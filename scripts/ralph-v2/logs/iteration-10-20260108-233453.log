US-C10 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-C11 through US-C20), so another iteration will continue the work.

**Summary of US-C10: Implement delete collection**
- Added `deleteCollection` function to `src/lib/collections.ts`
- Added delete button with trash icon on collection detail page (visible only to owner)
- Added confirmation dialog with warning about irreversible action
- Redirects to /collections after successful deletion
- Works for both empty and non-empty collection states
- All quality checks pass (typecheck + build)
