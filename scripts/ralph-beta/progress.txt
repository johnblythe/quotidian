## 2026-01-08 - US-B01: Update Quote interface to include themes array
- Added Theme type with 10 theme categories: 'adversity' | 'death' | 'discipline' | 'joy' | 'relationships' | 'work' | 'identity' | 'time' | 'wisdom' | 'simplicity'
- Updated Quote interface to include optional themes: Theme[] field
- Updated all 55 quotes in quotes.json to include empty themes arrays
- Files modified: src/types/index.ts, src/data/quotes.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Theme field is optional (themes?: Theme[]) for backwards compatibility
  - Empty arrays in JSON are valid - future stories will populate actual themes
  - All acceptance criteria items must be verified before marking passes: true

  - Animation classes: .page-transition (initial hidden) + .page-transition-enter (visible)
  - For Next.js App Router, client-side navigation doesn't trigger full page reload, so transitions apply on initial load
  - Always respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility compliance
---

## 2026-01-08 - US-B10: Add button hover and active states
- Added 3 CSS utility classes in globals.css:

- Uses getBoundingClientRect() to force reflow for animation restart
- Added prefers-reduced-motion support to disable animations
- Files modified: src/app/globals.css, src/components/ActionButtons.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Heart animation CSS classes: .heart-icon (base), .heart-filled (pop), .heart-unfilled (shrink)
  - Use getBoundingClientRect() (not offsetWidth) to force reflow on SVG elements for TypeScript
  - Track previous state with useRef to only animate on actual changes

## 2026-01-08 - US-B14: Improve textarea auto-resize smoothness
- Rewrote auto-resize logic in ReflectionEditor.tsx to eliminate jumpiness
- New approach: temporarily disable CSS transition during measurement, measure with height:auto, restore original height, re-enable transition, then animate to target
- Uses requestAnimationFrame to ensure smooth transition between frames
- Added .textarea-smooth-resize CSS class in globals.css with 150ms height transition
- Added overflow: hidden to prevent scroll during resize
- Added window resize listener to handle responsive font size changes
- Added prefers-reduced-motion support to disable transition for accessibility

- Files created: src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts, src/components/KeyboardShortcutsHelp.tsx
- Files modified: src/app/page.tsx, src/app/archive/page.tsx, src/app/favorites/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useKeyboardShortcuts hook takes object with optional handlers: onSave, onReflect, onEscape, onNavigateUp, onNavigateDown, onHelp
  - KeyboardShortcutsHelp takes context prop ("home" or "list") to show relevant shortcuts
  - Use useRef to store handlers and avoid stale closure issues
  - Use itemRefs array with ref callbacks to track DOM elements for scrollIntoView
  - Selected items get bg-foreground/5 highlight with smooth transition
