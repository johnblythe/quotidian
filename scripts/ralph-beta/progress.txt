# Ralph Progress Log - Beta Phase
Started: 2026-01-08

## Codebase Patterns
(Inherited from alpha - see scripts/ralph/progress.txt)
- Theme type in src/types/index.ts - 10 theme categories for quotes
- Quote interface now has optional themes: Theme[] field
- Button CSS utilities: .btn-icon (scale), .btn-primary (glow), .btn-nav (background) in globals.css

## 2026-01-08 - US-B01: Update Quote interface to include themes array
- Added Theme type with 10 theme categories: 'adversity' | 'death' | 'discipline' | 'joy' | 'relationships' | 'work' | 'identity' | 'time' | 'wisdom' | 'simplicity'
- Updated Quote interface to include optional themes: Theme[] field
- Updated all 55 quotes in quotes.json to include empty themes arrays
- Files modified: src/types/index.ts, src/data/quotes.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Theme field is optional (themes?: Theme[]) for backwards compatibility
  - Empty arrays in JSON are valid - future stories will populate actual themes
  - All acceptance criteria items must be verified before marking passes: true

## 2026-01-08 - US-B02: Research and add 25 Seneca quotes with themes
- Added 25 new Seneca quotes (seneca-011 through seneca-035) with properly tagged themes

## 2026-01-08 - US-B09: Add page transition animations
- Created PageTransition component in src/components/PageTransition.tsx
- Uses CSS opacity+transform animation with requestAnimationFrame for smooth triggering
- Added page transition CSS in globals.css with 200ms fade-in + subtle slide-up effect

  - Animation classes: .page-transition (initial hidden) + .page-transition-enter (visible)
  - For Next.js App Router, client-side navigation doesn't trigger full page reload, so transitions apply on initial load

- Added 3 CSS utility classes in globals.css:
