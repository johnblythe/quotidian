**US-B16: Add milestone celebration for 100 reflections - COMPLETE**

**What was implemented:**
- Created `MilestoneCelebration` modal component in `src/components/MilestoneCelebration.tsx`
- Added `getTotalReflectionCount()` function to `src/lib/journal.ts`
- Modified `saveJournalEntry()` to return boolean indicating if entry is new vs update
- Integrated milestone check into `ReflectionEditor` - checks after each new reflection is saved
- Milestone tracking uses localStorage (`quotidian_shown_milestones`) to ensure modal only shows once

**Files created:**
- `src/components/MilestoneCelebration.tsx`

**Files modified:**
- `src/lib/journal.ts`
- `src/components/ReflectionEditor.tsx`

**UI description:** When user creates their 100th reflection, a centered modal appears with:
- A decorative ✦ symbol
- Title: "A Century of Reflections"
- Message celebrating the milestone
- "Continue" button to dismiss
- Can also click outside or press Escape to close
