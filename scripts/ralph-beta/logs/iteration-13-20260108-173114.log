US-B13 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-B14 through US-B25), so I'll end my response normally. Another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-B13 implementation:**
- Created `Toast.tsx` with reusable Toast component, ToastProvider context, and useToast hook
- Toast appears at bottom of screen, auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
- Added slide-in animation with prefers-reduced-motion support
- Integrated toasts on: save/remove favorite, save reflection (debounced), update settings
- All quality checks pass (typecheck + build)
- Committed with message: `feat: US-B13 - Add toast notification system`
