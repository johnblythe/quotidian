**US-B04 Complete!**

Summary of what was implemented:
- Added 20 new Epictetus quotes (epictetus-011 through epictetus-030) 
- Added themes to existing 10 Epictetus quotes (epictetus-001 through epictetus-010)
- All quotes sourced from Enchiridion and Discourses (Books 1, 2, 3)
- Each quote has 2 accurately tagged themes
- No duplicates
- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both pass
- Files modified: `src/data/quotes.json`
- PRD updated to mark US-B04 as `passes: true`
- Progress log updated

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-B05 through US-B25), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
