**US-B03 completed.** 

Summary:
- Added 25 new Marcus Aurelius quotes (marcus-011 through marcus-035) from Meditations
- Added themes to all 35 Marcus Aurelius quotes
- All quotes have proper source attribution (Meditations, Book X)
- Themes accurately tagged (death, time, adversity, discipline, wisdom, identity, simplicity, joy, relationships, work)
- No duplicate quotes
- TypeCheck and build pass
- Changes committed: `feat: US-B03 - Research and add 25 Marcus Aurelius quotes with themes`

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-B04 through US-B25), so the next iteration will continue with US-B04.
