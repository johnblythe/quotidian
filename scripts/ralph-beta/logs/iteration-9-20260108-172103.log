**US-B09 completed.** Implemented page transition animations:

- Created `PageTransition` component using CSS opacity+transform animation (200ms)
- Wrapped all pages: home, archive, favorites, settings
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility
- All quality checks pass (typecheck + build)
- Committed: `feat: US-B09 - Add page transition animations`

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-B10 through US-B25), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
