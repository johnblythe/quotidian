There's still one story with `passes: false` - US-B25 (Cross-browser and device testing fixes). My work for this iteration is complete.

**Summary of US-B24 - Performance optimization pass:**

Implemented the following optimizations:

1. **Font optimization** - Switched from `@fontsource` packages to `next/font/google` for Inter and Lora fonts. This provides automatic font optimization with display:swap, subsetting, and self-hosting. Removed ~7.3MB from node_modules.

2. **Bundle optimization** - Added dynamic imports for rarely-used modal components (KeyboardShortcutsHelp, MilestoneCelebration, PhilosopherModeActivated, Confetti) so they're only loaded when needed.

3. **Unused asset cleanup** - Removed 5 unused SVG files from public/ directory (Next.js boilerplate leftovers).

4. **Images** - PWA icons were already optimized and small.

All quality checks pass (`npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`).
