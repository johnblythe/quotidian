**US-B21 completed.** The archive empty state now shows:
- Open book icon in a circular background
- "Your journey begins" heading
- Helper text explaining the archive purpose
- CTA link to see today's quote

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-B22 through US-B25), so the next iteration will pick up US-B22.
