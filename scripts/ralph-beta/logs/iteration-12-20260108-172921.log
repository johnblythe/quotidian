US-B12 completed. There are still more stories with `passes: false` (US-B13 through US-B25), so the next iteration will pick up US-B13.

**Summary - US-B12: Add heart fill animation on favorite**

Implemented:
- Heart icon animates from outline to filled with a scale bounce (heart-pop: 300ms cubic-bezier)
- Unfavorite has reverse animation (heart-shrink: 200ms ease-out)
- Animation only triggers on state change, not initial mount
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
- All acceptance criteria met, typecheck and build pass
