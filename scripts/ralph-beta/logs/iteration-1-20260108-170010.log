I'm on `ralph/beta-polish` but the PRD says `branchName: "ralph/quotidian-mvp"`. Let me check if there are any incomplete stories in the PRD - I already saw all 30 have `passes: true`.

Looking at the PRD:
- All 30 user stories have `passes: true`
- Branch name is `ralph/quotidian-mvp` 

The MVP phase is complete. All stories pass.

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
