US-B19 is complete. The PRD still has more stories with `passes: false` (US-B20 through US-B25), so there's more work to be done.

**Summary of US-B19 Implementation:**
- Created `Confetti` component with 30 animated pieces
- CSS animation with rotation and horizontal drift 
- localStorage tracking for first-time-only trigger
- Checks both localStorage AND database to ensure first favorite
- Integrated into both click and keyboard handlers
- prefers-reduced-motion accessibility support
- All quality checks pass, committed
