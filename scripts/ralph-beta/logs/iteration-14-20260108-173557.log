I've completed **US-B14: Improve textarea auto-resize smoothness**. 

**Summary of changes:**
- Rewrote the auto-resize logic in ReflectionEditor.tsx using a flicker-free measurement technique
- Added `.textarea-smooth-resize` CSS class with 150ms height transition and overflow:hidden
- Added window resize listener to handle responsive font size changes
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility

**UI behavior:**
- Textarea now grows and shrinks smoothly as content is added/removed
- No visual jump or flash during resize
- Maintains minimum height based on editor state (80px, 120px, or 160px)
- Works correctly on both mobile and desktop

There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-B15 through US-B25).
