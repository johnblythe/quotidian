US-V05 is complete. There are still more stories with `passes: false` (US-V06 through US-V19), so the work continues.

**Summary of US-V05 implementation:**
- Added `algorithmEnabledAt` field to `UserPreferences` type
- Created `getFirstSignalDate()` to find earliest signal timestamp
- Created `shouldEnableAlgorithm()` - checks if 14+ days since first signal
- Created `checkAlgorithmStatus()` - returns enabled state and whether just enabled
- Refactored `selectNextQuote()` to:
  - During cold start (<14 days): use pure random selection
  - After cold start: use weighted algorithm
  - Return `{ quote, algorithmJustEnabled }` for US-V06 celebration feature
- Both `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass
