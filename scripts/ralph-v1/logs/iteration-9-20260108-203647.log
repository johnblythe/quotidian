**US-V09 Complete.**

Summary of what was implemented:
- Created `/src/app/journeys/page.tsx` - lists all 7 journeys with emoji, title, description, and duration
- Added "Journeys" navigation item in `Navigation.tsx` with a layers icon, positioned between Favorites and Settings
- Both typecheck and build pass

Next story remaining: US-V10 (Implement start journey flow) and others (US-V10 through US-V19 still have `passes: false`).
