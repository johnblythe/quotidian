**US-V07 Complete.** 

Summary of what was done:
- Added `UserJourney` interface with fields: id, journeyId, startedAt, completedAt (optional), day, quotesShown[]
- Added `journeys` table to Dexie schema (version 3)
- Both typecheck and build pass
- Committed: `feat: US-V07 - Create journeys table in IndexedDB`

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-V08 through US-V19), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
