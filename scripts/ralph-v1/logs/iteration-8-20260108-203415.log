US-V08 is complete. Let me verify the status of all stories to check if there are more to complete.

Looking at the PRD, there are still stories US-V09 through US-V19 with `passes: false`. The next iteration will pick up US-V09: Create Journeys page in settings.

**Summary of US-V08 completion:**
- Created `src/data/journeys.json` with 7 curated journey definitions
- Added `JourneyDefinition` interface to types
- All 7 journeys match the acceptance criteria with proper author/theme filters
- Typecheck and build pass
- Changes committed with proper message
