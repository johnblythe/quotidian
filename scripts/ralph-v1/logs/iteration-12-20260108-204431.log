**US-V12 Complete.** 

Implemented:
- Added "Exit Journey" button to JourneyHeader component (displays when onExit prop provided)
- Confirmation modal on homepage when user clicks Exit
- On confirm: deletes active journey, resets to normal quote selection, shows toast

There are still stories with `passes: false` in the PRD (US-V13 through US-V19), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
