US-V13 is complete. Let me check if all stories are done or if there are more with `passes: false`:

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-V14 through US-V19), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-V13: Add journey completion celebration**

Implemented:
- Created `JourneyCompletion.tsx` modal component with celebration UI showing journey emoji and congratulations
- Detection logic in homepage: journey.day > duration triggers completion
- Also handles early completion when all quotes exhausted (getJourneyQuote returns null)
- Calls `completeActiveJourney()` to set `completedAt` timestamp for archive tracking
- Added `advanceJourneyDay()` after each daily quote view
- Two action buttons: "Start Another Journey" (→ /journeys) or "Return to Daily Quotes"
- Modal is user-dismissible (no auto-timeout like personalization celebration)

Files:
- Created: `src/components/JourneyCompletion.tsx`
- Modified: `src/app/page.tsx` (imports, state, handlers, render)
