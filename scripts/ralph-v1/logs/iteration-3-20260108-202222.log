US-V03 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-V04 through US-V19), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary: US-V03 Complete**

Implemented `getThemeAffinities()` function that:
- Fetches all signals from IndexedDB
- Aggregates signal weights by theme
- Returns sorted list of themes with scores (highest first)
- Handles empty signals case

Files changed:
- `src/lib/signals.ts` - added function
- `src/types/index.ts` - added ThemeAffinity interface
