US-V02 is complete. Let me verify there are more stories to complete by checking the PRD.

There are still many stories with `passes: false` (US-V03 through US-V19), so this iteration is complete but the overall project is not done yet.

**Summary of US-V02 Implementation:**

- Created `src/lib/signals.ts` with `recordSignal()` function and `SIGNAL_WEIGHTS` constant
- Signal recording integrated into:
  - `favorites.ts`: 'favorite' (+3) and 'unfavorited' (-2) signals
  - `journal.ts`: 'reflected' (+2) and 'reflected_long' (+3 when > 500 chars) signals
  - `history.ts`: 'viewed' (0) and 'another' (-1) signals
- Updated `page.tsx` to capture the rejected quote ID when user requests another quote
- All quality checks pass (typecheck and build)
- Committed: `feat: US-V02 - Record signals on user actions`
